# Franchise Movie Data
Data engineering and analysis project about franchise movies using Python, Processing and Google Looker Studio.

## Results

### Dashboard
For interactive exploration I created an online-dashboard using Google Looker Studio.
It allows you to filter for a specific franchise and look at the related data.
There's also an option to switch between historic- and inflation-adjusted values.

Below you can see a screenshot of the online-dashboard made with Google Looker Studio.
